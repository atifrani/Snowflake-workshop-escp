It is in a great hip area with tons of great independent designer boutiques, lovely restaurants and art galleries. When we arrived there was even a farmers market just steps away from her door. She gave great directions to get to her place and her business partner was happily waiting there when we arrived. He gave us great suggestions on what to do in the city and sat down with us for about an hour explaining great walks and great places to see in Berlin. Her place was clean, tidy and everything that we needed to stay there for the three nights. If we ever get a chance to go to Berlin again, we would definitely stay here again",positive

My husband and I loved the apartment and were very sad when we had to leave. Everything was very comfortable and you could not ask for a better location. We made sure to see other areas as well (Charlottenberg, Kreuzberg, FSchein, etc), and nothing compares to the lovliness of this section of Prenzlauer Berg. It is our hope that we can find an apartment just like Brittas so that we can spend more time in Berlin.",positive

It is truly a beautiful apartment  in a perfect location close to many good cafes and restaurants.

3176,2012-07-31T00:00:00Z,Sven,"We spent one week in Berlin at this amazing flat in a simply wonderful location. With a daughter of 16months old, Prenzlauer Berg I would say is the perfect place to enjoy Berlin whilst allowing your child to explore what seemed to be a sandpit on every corner of every block brEqually as adults we enjoyed the amazing choice of restaurants in the neighbourhood. We did travel to other areas of this vast sprawling city, but couldnt wait to get back to the calmness of this light and airy flat and its tree lined surroundings We would most definitely recommend staying in this apartment. We would love to come back and stay here again and explore this fantastic city ",positive

3176,2012-09-19T00:00:00Z,Anna,"Wonderful large, clean and airy apartment in one of my favourite parts of Berlin. Loved the neighbourhood, so easy to get around and way better than staying in a hotel. Only thing I would add is it would be nice to be able to leave bags there on check out day. We had to check out at 11am which seemed quite early and as we werent flying the the evening it would have been nice to have the option for a late check out, or somewhere to leave bags in the building",positive
3176,2012-09-30T00:00:00Z,Beck,"The apartment was great, couldnt have been happier. The neighbourhood has lots of characterlots going on but is still peaceful to go to sleep at night. 1015 minute walks to be in the heart of the action and really close to the train and tram systems. The apartment has great space (could easily hold a small family or 4 people if using the day bed) and has lovely natural light all throughout. brCommunication with Maarten was incredible, he always got back to us really quickly and kindly arranged a last minute booking late at night. brIf I go back to Berlin Id definitely try and get this place again.brThanks Maarten (and Britta and Marcus.)",positive
3176,2012-10-26T00:00:00Z,Dominique,"We really enjoyed our Short break holiday in Berlin and this beautiful flat was certainly part of it. We couldnt have picked a better flat. It is exactly as described. It is located on the first floor and we thought it was very quiet and very homely. We had tons of space for the two of us. The bed is also very comfortable (I have a dodgy back). The location was perfect. We were spoilt for choice regarding restaurants or cafés as there are about 10 (more even) just around the house : we did like Endlos (leaving the house, turn left and cross the road). The underground station is only 5 minutes away, the tram to Alexander Platz is at the end of the road. Or Alexander Platz itself is only a 1015 minute stroll. From there you can travel anywhere in the city. We found that we could walk to a lot of landmarks (Brandenburger Tor, Dom, Reichstag etc.) very easily. The supermarket (organic) is down the road (turn left and walk for about 23 minutes). In a nutshell we loved it and wed definitely be back. ",neutral
3176,2012-11-07T00:00:00Z,Tijn & Corinne,"The location off the apartment is the best, smack in the middle of all the action: bars  restaurants  shops. The apartment self is nice and spacious the only things what we missed was a coffeemachine, so you didnt have to get dressed to go outside to get our first coffee, a little radio would have been nice also, just to bring some liveliness in to the apartment. And 1 roll of toiletpaper for 4 days isnt enough ;)  Contact with Maarten  Britta and there manager Marcus was strict and business.

It seemed that every time we needed something it was just around the corner. There is a great organic supermarket down the road. Markets, restaurants, cafes and parks, and the metro and tram are all really close and everything is easy to get to.brAll our communication with Britta and Maarten, and Marcus, was quick and easy and they were always very helpful. The apartment itself could not have been better. It is really peaceful, light and roomy and has everything we needed.

3176,2013-01-28T00:00:00Z,Idil,"the place was so good I think. first we came we saw that the house is more little than what we see in photos. but its not a problem. the location of the house is perfect. the street is beautiful. it is positioned between a restaurant and a cyrstal store. when you see the house you can easily understand that it has a nice and sympathetic energy with all its little details.

The flat is quite, with character and perfectly situated just near Kolwillplatz where you can start the day with a perfect brunch. We found Prenzlauer Berg was one of the most charming neighbourhoods in Berlin but its easy, as we did, to rent bikes around the corner or take the trammetro within a short walking distance to explore the other parts of the city. Preparatory communication by email with Britta was straightforward and clear and Marcus welcomed us simply and nicely despite our late arrival, helping us to really enjoy our stay.",positive

Great shopping, great sightseeing, lovely food en great markets all around. There just a minor thing to mention, if you stay here with someone you like but you dont want to sleep lepeltjelepeltje (Dutch expression for sleeping really close to each other), the bed could be too small so someone has to sleep in the daybed, which is fine but in the living room.

The apartment itself  was nice and they were able to provide a crib and high chair. The water heater went out twice. The first time a plumber was sent and the second time we were able to reset the pilot light ourselves. The lack of hot water was inconvenient, especially with a baby, but Britta and her management company were helpful and responsive. This was the first AirBnB property I have stayed in (over 20x) that was run by a service rather than a host who was present. We paid an extra 20 for arriving after 9PM.

3176,2014-11-22T00:00:00Z,Sarah,"We had a good welcome from Rebecca who helps to manage the apartment and, although the flat had not been cleaned from the previous let when we arrived, this was quickly sorted and Britta phoned to apologise.  Britta supplied very helpful directions to find the apartment from Tegel Airport and there was an abundance of local maps and guide books to sift through to plan our sightseeing while in Berlin for only two days.  The flat is delightful and a bit quirky, warm and comfortable.  We were even more impressed to have a supply of tea and coffee which we had forgotten to buybrThe apartment is in a quiet neighbourhood but with easy access to central areas.  Lots of good eateries, bars and cafes nearby and a great Saturday market just up the street.  Warmly recommended.",positive

3176,2014-12-31T00:00:00Z,Karl,"Stayed for three nights in Brittas apartment Although we had difficulties finding the apartment (building unmarked and very unclear to find) after a while with no phone (as true travellers) we were able to make contact with Britta who then made contact with the people managing the place whilst she was away. We later had problems with the door and how to unlock it but after making contact with the managers at Berlin Cribs we easily solved the issue and found out how to open the door (stressful but quickly solved situation). After the initial difficulties of the first night we had a great stay and really enjoyed it. The tram is really close by and from there really easy connections can be made all over Berlin. The location of the apartment is very central and there is a cute strip of restaurants literally outside the door step (we recommend the restaurant on the corner opposite the apartment block (really good food) Overall really good stay and loved Berlin and the apartment, good beds, nice location and lovely host ",positive
